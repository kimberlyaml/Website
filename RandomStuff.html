<h3> This is kinda where I am going to be ranting about the most random stuff so ... just letting you know.</h3>
<h4> First topic .... braces .. </h4>
Now, for those of you that already went through this. I congratulate you on your journey and encourage you to reminise on the time you had them, for my sake
For those of you who have never had them and won't ever have them. I envy you and hate you, simultaneously.
I wish invisalign was free. I am sick and tired of having to sacrifice my comfort in my mouth because I want to eat an apple.
Not only that but like, if you ever have them tightened. UGH. You won't be able to eat comfortably for a whole week. So, just to keep this from being too long,
braces suck, they should be banned, and invisalign should be free :|

  <h4> Second Topic ... gender discrimination in clothing stores </h4>
  Alright, hear me out. I don't know if you've taken a peek at the boys section in stores but I was wandering in forever 21 one day and I saw a cute jacket in the women's section.
  I also happened to see a similar ones in the men's section. The difference in price was like ten dollars. That's when I started noticing that clothing for women is like 10 times more expensive than men.
  I hate that. Like I already hate the fact that half of women's clothing is so varying, which is both good and bad, but the most basic shirts cost 20 dollars.

  <h4> Third topic .. last one by the way .. documentaries</h4>
    Seriously underrated. They are not only the holy grail of things to watch as you are in indecisive of what to watch. There are documentaries on EVERYTHING .. from cooking to murder documentaries.
    You are being entertained while being educated on the topic of which you chose to watch. There are also varying lengths of docummentaries. There are series that have like 10 episodes each,
    there are documentaries that you can finish in one sitting and is about the length of a movies. Point being that documentaries have things for everyone. There's ones about crime, the food industry, medical mysteries, and tons of others.
    Here if anything I'll give you some to watch.There's Evil Genius (it's on Netflx still, I'm pretty sure). There's also the movie Zodiac and Icarus (olympic scandal). Finally, Strong Island (another crime documentary).
